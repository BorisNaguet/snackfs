This project requires SBT to generate a distribution of the project.
SBT can be set up from the instructions on
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html#installing-sbt

Execute the following command in the project directory
    [snackfs]$ sbt dist

This will result in a "snackfs.tar.gz" file in the "target" directory of "snackfs".

To run the project,
    1. start Cassandra v1.2.9
    2. Extract "snackfs.tar.gz" at desired location and grant user permissions to read,
        write and execute the script ‘snackfs’ located in bin directory
    3.In bin/snackfs set JAVA_HOME
    4.It is possible to configure the file system by updating core-site.xml.
        The following properties can be added.
           fs.cassandra.host (default 127.0.0.1)
           fs.cassandra.port (default 9160)
           fs.consistencyLevel.write (default QUORUM)
           fs.consistencyLevel.read (default QUORUM)
           fs.keyspace (default snackfs)
           fs.replicationFactor (default 3)
           fs.replicationStrategy (default org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy)
    5.Hadoop like fs commands can now be run from the extracted snackfs directory. For example,
       bin/snackfs fs -mkdir snackfs:///random
